## Introduction:

A portfolio website for photography and programming to showcase my work. Designed with a minimalist and clean aesthetic. Also including information about my background and approach.

Designed to showcase those projects in a visually appealing and interactive way, including screenshots, videos, and code snippets, along with descriptions of each project and its purpose. This website also includes the resume and links to social media profiles and other online presences.

## Frameworks Used:

- NEXT js (React)
- Tailwind for styling
- Daisi ui for making components as I want to get this done on a smaller time frame
- Framer
- Fancy apps for Lightbox

Expected time to get a production ready deployment: 1 week.
