## Frameworks Used:

- NEXT js (React)
- Tailwind for styling

# User Stories

## Main

Create a portfolio website to showcase the freelancing work iâ€™ve done in the past year.

- [ ] Organise by catergory: concert, event, family video - why I chose next.js to solve the routing problem.
- [ ] Lightbox (**window overlay) to view photos in full detail**
- [ ] Gallery for each catergory using images optimised from compression on sites such as:

[Resize multiple images at once!](https://www.iloveimg.com/resize-image)

[TinyPNG - Compress WebP, PNG and JPEG images intelligently](https://tinypng.com/)

## Future implementation

- [ ] Form for people to be able to contact me directly and is coded in the backend.
